# Glytt

An OpenGL engine made in C/C++.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run and develop the engine you will need a machine supporting at least OpenGL 4.3. Furthermore, you will need to setup the following libraries:

* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)

To ensure a more comfortable project setup, I'd recommend using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

Setting up the libraries can be done in a multitude of ways. I can't confidently recommend any certain way. I'm personally developing in a Windows 10 environment with MinGW. I'm using pre-compiled binaries for both GLFW and GLEW.

### Installing

Installing the repo is nearly as easy as cloning this repo and setting up the libraries (which isn't always hassle-free).

To ensure a more comfortable project installation and setup, I'd recommend using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) since that's what I'm using for developing the project.'

If all libraries are set up, all you need to do is compile and run the build! Three-dee away!
